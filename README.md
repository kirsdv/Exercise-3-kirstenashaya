# Exercise 3 - For loops and conditional statements (10 points)

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to edit the notebook files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 3 is due by 9:00 am, 14 Feb 2024**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!
- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise.

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 3](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L3/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html#exercise-3-hints) if you're having trouble.

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 3 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g., `exercise-3-davewhipp`) in the instance using Git as we saw in [**Lesson 2**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).

## Start working

There are 4 problems in this week's exercise. Problem 4 is *optional* but fun!

1. [Problem 1 - Batch processing data files with a for loop (2 points)](Exercise-3-problem-1.ipynb)
2. [Problem 2 - Classifying temperatures (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-2.ipynb)
3. [Problem 3 - Allocating locations (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-3.ipynb)
4. [Problem 4 - Nested `for` loops (*optional*, 0 points)](Exercise-3-problem-4.ipynb)
